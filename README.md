## Etch-A-Sketch Project
### Description

This is a simple Etch-A-Sketch-style project created to practice DOM manipulation skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal is to make an interactive drawing board where users can draw by hovering over squares in a grid.
### Features

    Drawing Grid: Creates an n x n grid that acts as the drawing area.
    Color on Hover: Each cell changes color when the mouse hovers over it.
    Customizable Grid Size: User can change the grid size for more or fewer cells.
    Reset Button: Clears the grid to start a new drawing.

### How to Use

    Open index.html in your browser.
    Enter a grid size (e.g., 16 for a 16x16 grid) and generate the grid.
    Hover over cells to "draw" on the grid.
    Click the reset button to clear the grid.

### Files

    index.html: Basic HTML structure.
    style.css: Styles for layout and grid appearance.
    script.js: JavaScript code for creating and resetting the grid.

### Notes

This project is intended for learning purposes and might require researching additional JavaScript and CSS concepts, especially related to grid layout and event handling.
